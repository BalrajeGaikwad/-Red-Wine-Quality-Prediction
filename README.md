# -Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project aims to predict the quality of red wine using machine learning models. We implement Random Forest for classification and regression, applying Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal model performance.


ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Red Wine Quality dataset contains physicochemical properties of different red wine samples, along with their quality ratings. Using machine learning models, we analyze and predict wine quality based on these features.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
âœ” Uses the Red Wine Quality Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
âœ” Implements Random Forest for classification & regression
âœ” Applies Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning
âœ” Performs feature selection and importance analysis
âœ” Evaluates models using various metrics
